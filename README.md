# 港巴即時｜BusPulse HK

A lightweight Progressive Web App for checking real-time Hong Kong bus arrival information.

## Features

- Real-time ETA from KMB, Citybus and Green Minibus APIs provided by data.gov.hk.
- Save multiple routes and stops locally in the browser.
- Open an on-demand map on each route card to see the selected stop, all stops in route order, and a schematic connection line.
- Route lines are matched to the road network through OSRM where available, rather than drawing a straight line between stops.
- Preview the complete route map before selecting a stop, use browser GPS to zoom to the user's location, and choose a nearby stop directly from the map.
- Search route numbers by prefix, so entering `74` can return routes such as `74K` and `74X` where available.
- Installable as a PWA on supported mobile browsers.
- Mobile-first interface with a compact, colourful arrival board.

## Map notes

The map uses Leaflet with OpenStreetMap tiles. Stop coordinates come from the public transport APIs where available. The blue line follows a road-network driving route between official stops where routing is available; it is a visual approximation, not the operator's exact bus-only geometry or a live bus GPS trace. Location access is requested only when the user taps the location button and is handled by the browser.

## Run locally

Because the app uses a service worker, serve the folder over HTTP instead of opening `index.html` directly:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Then open <http://localhost:8080>.

## Data and privacy

The app calls the official public APIs directly from the browser. Saved routes stay in the browser's local storage; there is no application server or account system.
